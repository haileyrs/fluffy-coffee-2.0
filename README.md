This is a portfolio website based off a previous bootstrap template project, rebuilt in Vue. This website contains multiple responsive pages, including a portfolio page and a contact form. This site is all about my dog because I have an easier time writing about her than I would have creating a website about myself (and I think people will enjoy this more).
